    "Our goal from this notebook is reset the distributions of students' scores in a class. We are given the scores of the students in the class. \n",
    "Sometimes we could not evaluate if it is actually the students who did not study enough or the teacher who came up with a very difficult exam.\n",
    "To settle this, we will try to reset the scores of the students to a centered normal distribution. \n",
    "Later, that grade will be translated to a grade between 0 and 20 (as in the French system).\n",

    "rules for resetting the mean $\\mu$: \n",
    "- if the normal distribution has a mean that is less than $0$, the teacher could find himself in Prisoner's dilemma. \n",
    "    - he should recheck his exam, if he is find the exam is too difficult, he should reset the mean to 10.\n",
    "    - if he is confident that the exam is fair, he should reset the mean between 8-10. depending on the difficulty of the exam. He should avoid the extreme case where students     plotted against the exam and cooperated not to study.\n",
